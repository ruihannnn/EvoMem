  instructions: "Solve the following problem step by step. You now have the ability\
    \ to selectively write executable Python code to enhance your reasoning process,\
    \ e.g., calulating numbers and verifying math computations. Never directly just\
    \ printing your textual reasoning in Python. The Python code will be executed\
    \ by an external sandbox, and the output (returned as a dict with the message\
    \ in the \"message\" field) can be returned to aid your reasoning and help you\
    \ arrive at the final answer. The Python code should be complete scripts, including\
    \ necessary imports. \nEach code snippet is wrapped with \n```python\ncode snippet\n\
    ```.\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following format:\n\
    <answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\nYou have access\
    \ to procedural memory that contains guidelines from similar tasks. When solving\
    \ problems, carefully consider these guidelines and adapt them to the current\
    \ task. The memory system has learned from 13 successful task trajectories."
